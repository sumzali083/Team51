# 🛍️ OSAI Fashion — Product Pages & Search Feature

**Team 51 — Front-End Development Contribution**

This branch contains **all of my work** for the OSAI Fashion website, focusing on the product browsing experience, product page system, and the search functionality.

---

## 🔥 My Main Contributions

### ✅ **1. Product Category Pages (Men, Women, Kids)**

I developed complete product listing pages for:

* **Men’s**
* **Women’s**
* **Kids’**

Each page includes:

* A responsive product grid
* Category-appropriate product loading
* Pagination
* Search support
* Consistent visual layout

These pages provide users with a clean and structured shopping experience.

---

### ✅ **2. Individual Product Pages**

I implemented the full **product detail system**, which includes:

* Main product image and thumbnail gallery
* Title, pricing, and description
* Size selection
* Color options (where available)
* Add-to-bag button (demo functionality)
* Breadcrumb navigation for easy movement

Each product page dynamically displays information based on its ID.

---

### ✅ **3. Product Data File (All Product Information)**

I created and structured the product data used across the entire website.

The dataset includes:

* Product names
* Prices
* Categories
* Available sizes
* Available colors
* Multiple images per product
* Unique product IDs

This centralised data powers:

* Category pages
* Product detail pages
* Search filtering

---

### ✅ **4. Search Bar Functionality (Global Product Search)**

I implemented the website’s search system within the navigation bar.

Key features include:

* Keyword-based product matching
* Search that works across Men/Women/Kids
* Results displayed based on category
* URL query parameter handling (`?q=...`)
* Pagination adjusted to filtered results

This allows users to quickly find products without manually navigating categories.

---

### ✅ **5. Dynamic Product Listing Logic**

I built the logic that powers the category pages, including:

* Filtering
* Searching
* Pagination
* Responsive card rendering
* Hover image swap
* Dynamic linking to product pages

This creates a smooth browsing experience.

---

### ✅ **6. Styling & Layout**

I worked on front-end styling to ensure:

* Clean UI consistent with OSAI branding
* Responsive product grids
* Image hover effects
* Clear product information hierarchy
* Browser-friendly layout across pages

---

### ✅ **7. Product Images — Designed & Created by Me**

All product images used in:

* `/assets/men/`
* `/assets/women/`
* `/assets/kids/`

were **created, edited, and prepared by me**.

This includes:

* Image editing
* Cropping
* Color correction
* Aspect-ratio normalization
* Thumbnail creation
* Organised folder structure

These images form a large part of the website’s visual identity.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
