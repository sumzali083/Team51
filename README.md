# 🛍️ OSAI Fashion — Product Pages & Search Feature

**Team 51 — Front-End Development Contribution**

This branch contains **all of my work** for the OSAI Fashion website, focusing on the product browsing experience, product page system, and the search functionality.

---

## 🔥 My Main Contributions

### ✅ **1. Product Category Pages (Men, Women, Kids)**

I developed complete product listing pages for:

* **Men’s**
* **Women’s**
* **Kids’**

Each page includes:

* A responsive product grid
* Category-appropriate product loading
* Pagination
* Search support
* Consistent visual layout

These pages provide users with a clean and structured shopping experience.

---

### ✅ **2. Individual Product Pages**

I implemented the full **product detail system**, which includes:

* Main product image and thumbnail gallery
* Title, pricing, and description
* Size selection
* Color options (where available)
* Add-to-bag button (demo functionality)
* Breadcrumb navigation for easy movement

Each product page dynamically displays information based on its ID.

---

### ✅ **3. Product Data File (All Product Information)**

I created and structured the product data used across the entire website.

The dataset includes:

* Product names
* Prices
* Categories
* Available sizes
* Available colors
* Multiple images per product
* Unique product IDs

This centralised data powers:

* Category pages
* Product detail pages
* Search filtering

---

### ✅ **4. Search Bar Functionality (Global Product Search)**

I implemented the website’s search system within the navigation bar.

Key features include:

* Keyword-based product matching
* Search that works across Men/Women/Kids
* Results displayed based on category
* URL query parameter handling (`?q=...`)
* Pagination adjusted to filtered results

This allows users to quickly find products without manually navigating categories.

---

### ✅ **5. Dynamic Product Listing Logic**

I built the logic that powers the category pages, including:

* Filtering
* Searching
* Pagination
* Responsive card rendering
* Hover image swap
* Dynamic linking to product pages

This creates a smooth browsing experience.

### ✅ **6. Styling & Layout**

I worked on front-end styling to ensure:

* Clean UI consistent with OSAI branding
* Responsive product grids
* Image hover effects
* Clear product information hierarchy
* Browser-friendly layout across pages

---

### ✅ **7. Product Images — Designed & Created by Me**

All product images used in:

* `/assets/men/`
* `/assets/women/`
* `/assets/kids/`

were **created, edited, and prepared by me**.

This includes:

* Image editing
* Cropping
* Color correction
* Aspect-ratio normalization
* Thumbnail creation
* Organised folder structure

These images form a large part of the website’s visual identity.
